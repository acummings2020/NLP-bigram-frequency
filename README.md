# NLP-bigram-frequency
First solo project heavily using NLP methods outside of sentiment analysis

This project contains python code to read in texts from json-type social media post text. Once read in, the most frequent pairings(bigrams) of words were collected and analyzed, and paired with other features such as geographic area.
